## Experimental Project: **Growth and characterization of single crystals of superconducting NbSe2**.
* Introduction: 
This an experimental reseach practice projuct. **Tianli Liu** and I collaborate on this project. We grow the
NbSe2 crystal by chemical vapor transport(CVT) and determine the lattice structure of our samples
by X-ray difraction(XRD), both powder and piece samples conformity the standard sample. We also
test the electronic transport properties by PPMS and and that the resistance drop to zero around
7.14K, which consist of previous works.
* Reports:
You are free to check the report here: [PDF](../files/ExpSC_GengpuLi.pdf)


## Project: **hBN-CNTs superlattices**.
I'm collating the notes and reports, they will be published here soon around Jan. 2021
