+ I'm an undergraduate student in Physics Department, [Zhiyuan Colledge](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiaotong University](https:sjtu.edu.cn/) . Zhiyuan Colledge is a honor College where selected students share their ideas and research on the basic science.
+ My major is physics and my research interests include the **Condensed Matter Physics**, **Computational Physics**, **Mathematical Physics**, **Numerical Methods**.
+ I'm working in Prof. [Weidong Luo](http://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/wdluo) 's Group on properties of material like carbon nanotubes, hBNs, and magnetic materials. 
+ I'm also working with Prof. [Lei Zhang](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/lzhang/home.html) around the DFT theory.
+ I'm preparing for applying for a physics graduated programs 2021. If you are interesting, please look my CV.

## Research interests
* **Condensed Matter Physics**: DFT Calculations, Multi-body physics, Magnetism.
* **Mathematical Physics**: Dynamic Systems, PDEs.
