+ I'm an undergraduate student in the Physics Department, [Zhiyuan Colledge](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https:sjtu.edu.cn/). Zhiyuan Colledge provides an honor undergraduate program that selects students with high academic records and enthusiasm in basic science.
+ I major in physics and my research interests include **Condensed Matter Physics**, **Computational Physics**, **Mathematical Physics**, **Cosmology**.
+ I'm working in Prof. [Weidong Luo](http://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/wdluo) 's Group on properties of material like carbon nanotubes, hBNs, and magnetic materials. 
+ Now I'm preparing my Bachelor thesis: The CNT-hBN superlattices.
+ I'm preparing to apply for a physics graduate program in 2021. I want to study gravity and cosmology in graduate research. If you are interesting, please look at my CV.
