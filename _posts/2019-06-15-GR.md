In this semester(Spring 2019), I took the courses about General Relativity directed by [Pengjie Zhang](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/zhangpj). During reviewing the final exam, I read the class note and some comprehensions occurred to me which I would like to share with your in this blogs. I'm sorry for the poor communication(I'm not a native speaker) and some potentially wrong understand which may mislead you. I'm not an expert but a naive student in this area. However, I believe my identity of students may make you feel free to figure out my wrongs and promote our further and deeper discussion(That's why I'd like to discuss with peers). So, please contact with me by any way you like. Enjoy yourselves in GR!

## GR123, an Introduction
Prof. Zhang summarize GR by 1 principle, 2 equations and 3 applications(which is also the key points of final :sob:).
+ 1 principle
  + Equivalence Principle(EP)
    + Weak EP(WEP)
    + Einstein EP(EEP)
    + Strong EP(SEP)
+ 2 Equations
  +  geodesic equation
  +  Einstein's field equation
+ 3 applications
  + Strong Fields: The Black Hole
  + Weak Fields: The gravitation waves.
  + Cosmology.

In this post, I would like to introduce some basic knowledge about GR including the equivalence principle, the geodesic equation and its "deviation" which introduce the Riemann tensor and Einstein tensor. Further, after some discussion about energy momentum tensor, we can admire Einstein's great equation and its consequences(absolutely deferent from Newtonian.) Finally, an exact solution known as Schwarz's solution was also been introduce.

## Equivalence Principle
So, from the very beginning of GR, why Einstein believe that Newtonian Gravitation theory is not complete? As all of us know, It is seldom to see any gravitational phenomena which can not be described by the law of gravity:

$$
F=G\frac{Mm}{r^2}
$$

So, what defect in Newton's theory inspire Einstein to think about the GR? The first opinion I want to share you is the **None of reference frame is "special"**. Image that a particle accelerate as a and is interacted by another particle, Newton's second law tell us that:

$$
ma=-G\frac{Mm}{r^2}
$$
Nothing special is it? However the particle itself doesn't agree, it thinks that:"I don't have any acceleration, so I'm on mechanical balanced!"

$$
0=-G\frac{Mm}{r^2}-ma=m(-\frac{GM}{r^2}-a)
$$

The acceleration just like some additional gravitational field provided by the God. If particles are trapped by elevator and never know they are accelerated. The scientists of particles must conclude that:"Don't be nervous, we can't fell any gravitation!" Newtonian gravitation theory think this additional field is fake(pseudoforce), but Einstein doesn't agree. Please remember: **Nothing is special**. So, Einstein suggest that: Both law of gravitation and acceleration are **fake**, the gravitation is just some intrinsic property of space-time. If you can't understand, you can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg&t=428s) for further understand.

So come back to the particle in elevator, we can summarize the weak equivalence principle: **For uncharged test particle at any space-time point, there is a local inertial frame(LOF), in which the particle feel no gravitation** The restriction on charge is because the acceleration radiation is not easy to deal, so we exclude it from our theory. The statement can be translate more clear and lively, no matter where and when we are, we can find a elevator **locally**(at this space-time), in which we can safely say:"We can't feel any gravitation!"

## The Geodesic Equation
The consequence of WEP tell us how particles move is gravitational field. Before we begin the trip, some notation must be introduced:
