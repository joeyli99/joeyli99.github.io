In this semester(Spring 2019), I took a course about General Relativity directed by [Pengjie Zhang](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/zhangpj). While reviewing the final exam, I read the class note and some comprehensions that I would like to share with you in this blog. I'm sorry for the poor communication(I'm not a native English speaker) and some potentially wrong understanding, which may mislead you. I'm not an expert but a naive student in this area. However, I believe my students' identity may make you feel free to figure out my wrongs and promote our further and more in-depth discussion(That's why I'd like to discuss with peers). So, please contact me in any way you want. Enjoy yourselves in GR!

## GR123, an Introduction
Prof. Zhang summarizes GR by 1 principle, 2 equations and 3 applications(which is also the key points of final :sob:).
+ 1 principle
  + Equivalence Principle(EP)
    + Weak EP(WEP)
    + Einstein EP(EEP)
    + Strong EP(SEP)
+ 2 Equations
  +  geodesic equation
  +  Einstein's field equation
+ 3 applications
  + Strong Fields: The Black Hole
  + Weak Fields: The gravitation waves.
  + Cosmology.

In general, the GR suggests that **The matters tell space-time how to bend. The space-time tells matters how to move.** which was described mathematically by Einstein's field equation and geodesic equation. If you can't understand, you can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg&t=428s) for further understanding.

In this post, I would like to introduce some basic knowledge about GR, including the equivalence principle, the geodesic equation, and its "deviation," which introduces the Riemann tensor and Einstein tensor. Further, after some discussion about energy-momentum tensor, we can admire Einstein's great equation and its consequences(absolutely different from Newtonian.) Finally, I will introduce an exact solution known as Schwarz's solution. 

## Equivalence Principle

### All frameworks are created equally.

From the very beginning of GR, why Einstein believes that the Newtonian Gravitation theory is not complete? As all of us know, it is seldom to see any gravitational phenomenon which can not be described by the law of gravity:

$$
F=G\dfrac{Mm}{r^2}
$$

So, what defect in Newton's theory inspires Einstein to think about the GR? The first opinion I want to share with you is that **None of the reference frames is "special"**.

In special relativity, we know that no matter whether you are walking or not, physical laws, including mechanics, electromagnetic dynamics, hold in your inertial framework. The SR theory is so successful but still leaves a blank: what happens in an accelerated world? 

Now, image a free-falling particle on the earth, Newton's second law tells us that the motion of the particle is:

$$
ma=-G\dfrac{Mm}{r^2}
$$

Nothing special, is it? However, in the frame of the particle itself, it thinks that: "I do not have any acceleration, I am on mechanical balanced!" We can rewrite the equation in its frame by introducing an additional force term, know as pseudo-force.

$$
0=-G\dfrac{Mm}{r^2}-ma=m(-\dfrac{GM}{r^2}-a)
$$

These are well-known results in high school. However, the pseudo-force theory is not complete.

  1. The acceleration just like some additional gravitational field provided by no one, which doesn't consist with Newton's 3rd law. 
  2. **We unavoidably introduced a particular framework where no pseudo-force is needed, and universal gravitation holds**

There is no wrong if you keep going with pseudo-force. You will generate Newtonian gravitation theory by thinking this additional field is fake. But you may miss something beautiful. But Einstein, who believes that ** Nothing is special**, disagrees. If we abandon the stereotype of Newtonian mechanics, there is no reason for overstating the gravity and downplaying the acceleration.

Einstein suggests that: Both gravitation and acceleration are **fake**, the gravity and acceleration are both some intrinsic property or the "bending" of space-time.
He states the weak equivalence principle: **For uncharged test particle at any space-time point, there is a local inertial frame(LOF), in which the particle feels no gravitation and unaccelerated**

## The Geodesic Equation
The consequence of WEP tells us how particles move in a gravitational field. Before we begin the trip, some notation must be introduced:

1. The Greek letters $\mu, \eta, \nu$ run from 0 to 3 represent the time and space parts. 

2. The Latin letters i, j, k run from 1 to 3 and represent the space parts.
3. $\hbar=c=1$

4. The $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is the special relativity metric, $diag\{-1,1,1,1\}$

5. Einstein sum rule: the same upper index and lower index should be sum up, say: $A^\mu A_{\mu}=A^0 A_{0}+A^1 A_{1}+A^2 A_{2}+A^3 A_{3}$

6. $A_{\mu,\nu}$ is the abbreviation of $\dfrac{\partial A_{\mu}}{\partial x^\nu}$

7. $A_{\mu}^{\nu}$ is the abbreviation of $\dfrac{\partial A_{\mu}}{\partial x_\nu}$



In the former section, we can have a LIF in every space-time point. Using the mathematical language, the particle's motion in the natural frame (with 'gravity') $x^\mu$, can be derived from $\xi^\mu$ in LIF coordinates. For a world line(If you are not familiar with world line, please check the Special Relativity books) characterized by $\lambda$, it is clear that in LIF:

$$
\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2\xi^\mu}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^2}=0
$$

$$
0= \dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\xi^\mu}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}=\dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\left(\frac{\partial\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\right)\\
=\dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\left(\frac{\partial\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\right)\dfrac{\mathrm{d}x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}+\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^2} \frac{\partial\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\\
=\frac{\partial^2\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\beta}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}+\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^2} \frac{\partial\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\\
=\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial\xi^\mu}\frac{\partial^2\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\beta}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}+\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^2} \frac{\partial\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial\xi^\mu}\\
=\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial\xi^\mu}\frac{\partial^2\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\beta}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}+\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^2} \delta_{\nu\alpha}
$$

That is:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial\xi^\mu}\frac{\partial^2\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}\right)\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\beta}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}+\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2x^\nu}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^2}=0
$$

Define $\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial\xi^\mu}\frac{\partial^2\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}=\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta}$, the equation is:

$$
\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\beta}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}\dfrac{\mathrm{d} x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}+\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2x^\nu}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^2}=0
$$

This is the **Geodesic Equation**. and the $\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta}$ is call **connections** which connect the original coordinate $x^\nu$ to the LIF coordinate $\xi^\mu$ at this space-time. So if we know the changing coordinate relation between LIF and the original one, we can quickly get the motion equation.

We also noticed that LIF have a gauge freedom: $\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta}=0\rightarrow\frac{\partial x^\nu}{\partial\xi^\mu}\frac{\partial^2\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}=0$(multiply both side by$\frac{\partial\xi^\rho}{\partial x^\nu}$) $\rightarrow\frac{\partial^2\xi^\rho}{\partial x^\beta \partial x^\alpha}=0\rightarrow\xi^\mu$ is linear with $x^\nu$. (reminds us SR!)

We naturally assume that: SR is right in the LIF. This assumption leads us to the conception of metric

## Metric
Let us talk about metrics.

Before going through the GR, we back to the SR, the inertial system's fundamental principle, and review the interval.

In special relativity, the quantity $ds^2=-dt^2+dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$(c=1) is the space-time interval or by the Einstein's sum law:

$$
ds^2=\eta_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^v\\
\eta_{\mu\nu}=diag\{-1,1,1,1\}
$$

The interval is an invariant under the Lorentz transform. This fact consists of invariant lightspeed. Einstein's equivalence principle suggests that: **In LIF, the special relativity holds.**. As we mentioned in last section, EEP leads to a primary quantity of GR: the metric.

$$
ds^2=\eta_{\mu\nu}d\xi^\mu d\xi^v\\
=\eta_{\mu\nu}\dfrac{\partial\xi^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\dfrac{\partial \xi^\nu}{\partial x^\beta}dx^\alpha dx^\beta\\
=g_{\alpha\beta}dx^\alpha dx^\beta
$$

$$g_{\alpha\beta}=\eta_{\mu\nu}\dfrac{\partial \xi^\mu}{\partial x^\alpha}\dfrac{\partial \xi^\nu}{\partial x^\beta}$$

The metric can be considered as the "unit" of distance. In America, people use miles as the unit. It is clear that 1 mile not equals 1 km, so we need to use the "metric" to convert them into the same standard: 1 mile $\approx$ 1.6km. This 1.6 is nothing but the metric of American coordinate and International coordinate.

Besides, take Euclidean geometry as an example. As all of us known, the infinitesimal distance change in the Cartesian coordinates is $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$(Pythagorean theorem). And in spherical coordinates the answer is also trivial $ds^2=dr^2+r^2d\theta^2+r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2$. So, $(1,1,1)$, $(1, r^2,r^2sin^2\theta)$ is the metric of cartesian and spherical coordinates. 

In GR, we define $g^{\alpha\beta}=\eta^{\alpha\beta}\dfrac{\partial \xi^\alpha}{dx^\mu}\dfrac{\partial\xi^\beta}{\partial x^\nu}$. One can simply prove that $g^{\alpha\gamma}g_{\gamma\beta}=\delta^\alpha_\beta$. 
and a brilliant observation suggests:

$$
\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}=\dfrac{1}{2}g^{\mu\gamma}(g_{\gamma\alpha,\beta}+g_{\gamma\beta,\alpha}-g_{\alpha\beta,\gamma})
$$

Getting this equation is a good exercise for everyone interested in GR. Please try to prove it. So, if we know the metric, we can determine the connection and the motion of particles in gravity fields.

 I will take some extra sections to introduce the physical means and the consequence of g. 
### Further discussion of g
#### 1. The Gravitational potential.
If the gravitational fields is under the Newton limitation, which means $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}\ll 1$ and also $\partial g_{\mu\nu}/\partial t=0$ (static condition). For a particle moves slowly, the geodesic equation's dominant terms are (using the time as the parameter of world lines.)

$$
\frac{d^2x^i}{dt^2}=-\Gamma^i_{00}=-\dfrac{1}{2}g^{i\gamma}(g_{\gamma0,0}+g_{\gamma0,0}-g_{00,\gamma})=\dfrac{1}{2}h_{00,i}+o(h^2)
$$

Comparing with Newton's gravitation law, we have

$$
g_{00}=-(1+2\psi)
$$

where $\psi$ is the gravitational potential $\psi=-GMm/r$. So, the metric can directly be linked to gravitation.

#### 2. Shortest path
Geodesic is the shortest path if we define the "distance" by g.

$$s=\int^1_0\sqrt{g_{\mu\nu} \dfrac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}}d\lambda
$$

$$\delta s=\int^1_0\delta\sqrt{g_{\mu\nu} \dfrac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}}d\lambda\\
=\int\dfrac{1}{2}\left(g_{\mu\nu} \dfrac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}\right)^{-1/2}\left\{g_{\mu\nu,\alpha}\delta x^{\alpha}\dfrac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}+2g_{\mu\nu}\dfrac{d\delta x^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda} \right\}d\lambda\\
\propto \int_0^1 g_{\mu\nu,\alpha}\delta x^{\alpha}\dfrac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}+2g_{\mu\nu}\dfrac{d\delta x^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda} d\lambda\\
=\int_0^1 \left\{g_{\mu\nu,\alpha}\dfrac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}-2\left(g_{\alpha\mu,\nu}\dfrac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}+g_{\alpha\nu}\dfrac{d^2x^\nu}{d\lambda^2} \right)\right\} \delta x^{\alpha}d\lambda\\
=\int_0^1 \left\{g^{\rho\nu}\left(g_{\mu\theta,\rho}-2g_{\rho\mu,\theta}\right)\dfrac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\theta}{d\lambda}+2\dfrac{d^2x^\nu}{d\lambda^2} \right\} g_{\alpha\nu}\delta x^{\alpha}d\lambda\\
=\int_0^1 \left\{g^{\rho\nu}\left(g_{\mu\theta,\rho}-g_{\rho\mu,\theta}-g_{\rho\theta,\mu}\right)\dfrac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\theta}{d\lambda}+2\dfrac{d^2x^\nu}{d\lambda^2} \right\} g_{\alpha\nu}\delta x^{\alpha}d\lambda\\
=2\int_0^1\left\{\Gamma_{\mu\theta}^\nu\dfrac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\theta}{d\lambda}+\dfrac{d^2x^\nu}{d\lambda^2}\right\}g_{\alpha\nu}\delta x^\alpha d\lambda
$$

So, $\Gamma_{\mu\theta}^\nu\dfrac{d x^\mu}{d\lambda}\dfrac{dx^\theta}{d\lambda}+\dfrac{d^2x^\nu}{d\lambda^2}=0$ is the shortest path which is also the geodesic.

### Summary:
The first important quantity that describes gravity is the metric g. We can use the g to calculate the connection, and then get the motion of particles. In next section, we will introduce have to get the g.

## Tensor, the Riemann Tensor. 

I don't want to focus on the mathematical details of tensors. but just give a definition and apply it to GR.

If $T^{\alpha_1...\alpha_m}_{\beta_1...\beta_n}$ transform by:

$$
T^{\mu_1...\mu_m}_{\nu_1...\nu_n}(y)=T^{\alpha_1...\alpha_m}_{\beta_1...\beta_n}(x^\prime)(\dfrac{\partial y^{\mu_1}}{\partial x^{\alpha_1}}...\dfrac{\partial y^{\mu_m}}{\partial x^{\alpha_m}})(\dfrac{\partial x^{\beta_1}}{\partial y^{\nu_1}}...\dfrac{\partial x^{\beta_m}}{\partial x^{\nu_m}})
$$
,it is a tensor. Notice y and x describe same spacetime but different coordinates.
