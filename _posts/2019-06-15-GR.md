In this semester(Spring 2019), I took the courses about General Relativity directed by (Pengjie Zhang)[https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/zhangpj]. During reviewing the final exam, I read the class note and some comprehensions occurred to me which I would like to share with your in this blogs. I'm sorry for the poor communication and some potentially wrong understand which may mislead you. I'm not an expert but a naive student in this area. However, I believe my identity of students may make you feel free to figure out my wrongs and promote our further and deeper discussion(That's why I'd like to discuss with peers). So, please contact with me by any way you like. Enjoy yourselves in GR!

## GR123, an Introduction
Prof. Zhang summarize GR by 1 principle, 2 equations and 3 applications(which is also the key points of final :sob:).
+ 1 principle
  + Equivalence Principle(EP)
    + Weak EP(WEP)
    + Einstein EP(EEP)
    + Strong EP(SEP)
+ 2 Equations
  +  geodesic equation
  +  Einstein's field equation
+ 3 applications
  + Strong Fields: The Black Hole
  + Weak Fields: The gravitation waves.
  + Cosmology.
