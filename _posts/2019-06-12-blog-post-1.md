## Introduction
[Click here to see the pdf](..\files\Project_3.pdf)

This is my class project of Introduction to Computational Physics with **Yinan Chen** in which we simulate the Kirkwood gaps in asteroids belt.

The Kirkwood gaps which represents the absence of asteroids at certain semi-majors(see Figure). we will introduce some observed results of these gaps, as well as the theoretical method and approximations we conduct in our simulation. Furthermore, we will illustrate the symplectic algorithm we conduct in order to make the simulation more accurate. Finally we will show various results of our simulation and compare them to the observed values.

Our momention equation are cited from [Liu](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~dpsaltis/Phys305/liuetal.pdf) et. al. from University of Arizona. Thanks for they great works which inspires us much. We got more precise and reasonable result by employ the **symplectic** method published by Yoshida([Haruo Yoshida](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375960190900923)). This algorithm can provide a 8-th order and keep the quasi-energy conservation in long period.

## Momention
 Our first assumption is that the Sun is inert at the origin point. For Jupitor, the gravitational effect of the asteroid belt is ignor-able compared with that of the Sun, so our second assump-tion reads the Jupitor is only influenced by the Sun, and itsorbit is a closed ellipse. Based on these two assumptions, we can write down the equation of motion of Jupiter.

$$
M_J \dfrac{d^{2} \boldsymbol{r}_J}{d t^{2}}=G\dfrac{M_{S} M_{J}\left(-\boldsymbol{r}_{J}\right)}{\left|\boldsymbol{r}_{J}\right|^{3}}
$$

in xy-coordinates, we talk:
$$
\dfrac{d^{2} x_{J}}{d t^{2}}=-G\dfrac{M_{S} x_{J}}{\left(x_{J}^{2}+y_{J}^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\\
\dfrac{d^{2} y_{J}}{d t^{2}}=-G\dfrac{M_{S} y_{J}}{\left(x_{J}^{2}+y_{J}^{2}\right)^{3/2}}
$$

For asteroids, we ignore the effects of other asteroids.  Sothe equation of motion of any one asteroid reads

$$
m_{a} \dfrac{d^{2} \boldsymbol{r}_{a}}{d t^{2}}=G\dfrac{ M_{S} m_{a}\left(-\boldsymbol{r}_{a}\right)}{\left|\boldsymbol{r}_{a}\right|^{3}}+G\dfrac{M_{J} m_{a}\left(\boldsymbol{r}_{J}-\boldsymbol{r}_{a}\right)}{\left|\boldsymbol{r}_{J}-\boldsymbol{r}_{a}\right|^{3}}
$$

and also
$$
\frac{d^{2} x_{a}}{d t^{2}}=G\dfrac{M_{S}\left(-x_{a}\right)}{\left(x_{a}^{2}+y_{a}^{2}\right)^{3/2}}+G\dfrac{M_{J}\left(x_{J}-x_{a}\right)}{\left(\left(x_{J}-x_{a}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{J}-y_{a}\right)^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\\
\frac{d^{2} y_{a}}{d t^{2}}=G\dfrac{M_{S}\left(-y_{a}\right)}{\left(x_{a}^{2}+y_{a}^{2}\right)^{3/2}}+G\dfrac{M_{J}\left(y_{J}-y_{a}\right)}{\left(\left(x_{J}-x_{a}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{J}-y_{a}\right)^{2}\right)^{3/2}}
$$
