This is my class project of Introduction to Computational Physics.

I introduce the dynamics of Tippe Top(TT) in this post. A tippe top is a kind of tops that when spun, it will spontaneously invert itself to spin on its narrow stem. Because the system have high level of non-linear performance, the dynamics of TT is complicated and hard to understand. My work including an introduction
of TT and use numerical ode method to solve it. Further, I will carefully talk about the critical behaviors in the system which missing in preceding works.

The programming language is MATLAB.
