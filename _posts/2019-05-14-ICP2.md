This is my class project of Introduction to Computational Physics with **Yuanye Lin**.

we determine the minimum electrostatic potential
energy configuration of N electrons confined on the surface of a unit sphere with the electrostatic interaction energy given by the special potential U = −log(r). The hardest part is how to obtain the global minima. The classical methods including the Newton’s method, the conjugate gradient method have a common problem that they may lead to a local minima. We overcome it successfully by employing the **Genetic Algorithm(GA)** and implementing the algorithm by
MATLAB. Further, our result shows that there is no distinction between Coulomb’s potential.

The programming language is MATLAB.
